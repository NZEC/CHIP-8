SpaceJam!
=========
This game is an Octo-based original CHIP-8 style program designed and written by first-time Octo programmer / long-time programmer William Donnelly in a few days or so (zero to sixty in 1001 seconds, baby!) for the OctoJam II 2015 contest.

It's basically a Space Flight-Runner Game. Dodge the ceiling, floor and stars. Try to beat the system. If you can score 255 points the world will end. Good luck. (uses WASD for movement; any key to start, etc.)

It's an extended and enhanced version 'loosely based' on ShipTunnel from the 2014 OctoJam, with these changes and additions:

- Better ceiling and floor creation
- Score and 3 ships per game play
- Intro screen
- End-of-Game screens
- Obstacle Stars
- Other niceties and gameisms
- Tweaked the parameters for near-optimum / optimal play (?)
- It's not perfect, but it's very playable.

(see the 2014 game (here)[http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?gist=380d4a4a3e395759f7a4])

Thank you creator(s) of Octo. It's a really nice system. I had fun working with it. Always enjoy learning yet another programming language, and creating something along the way.
