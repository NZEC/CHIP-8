Piper is a little bird who is learning to collect shells and goodies on the beach. But when the wave comes in, she needs to hide in the sand to avoid getting wet. The waves wash in new goodies for Piper to pick up. Collect as many goodies as you can and don't get wet! 

By Lillian Wang, Jordan Mecom, and Alice Wang.
